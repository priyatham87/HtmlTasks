<p><strong>Bangalore</strong> is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_city">capital</a> and <mark>largest city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka</mark>. It has a population of more than 8 million and a metropolitan population of around 15 <sup>million</sup>, making it <u>India's third most populous city and fourth most populous urban agglomeration</u>. It is the most populous city and largest urban agglomeration in South India, and is the 27th largest city in the world.[11] Located on the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 <sub>ft</sub>) above sea level, Bangalore has a pleasant climate throughout the year, with its parks and green spaces earning it the reputation of India's <q>Garden City</q>.[12] Its elevation is the highest of India's major cities.[13]

<i>The city's history dates back to around 890, as per the old Kannada stone inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore</i>. In 1537, Kempé Gowdā, a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire, established a mud fort, considered the foundation of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or pétés, which still exist. After the fall of the Vijayanagara Empire, Kempe Gowda declared <abbr title="Independence">ind</abbr>; in 1638, a large Adil Shahi Bijapur army defeated Kempe Gowda III, and Bangalore came under Shahaji Bhonsle as a jagir, which later became his capital. The Mughals later captured Bangalore and sold it to Maharaja Devaraja <small>Wodeyar</small> II of the Kingdom of Mysore.<del>[14]</del> When Haider Ali seized control of the kingdom, Bangalore's administration passed into his hands</p>
